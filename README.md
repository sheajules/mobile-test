### Notes:

- Focus on modular designs & DI

- Added a caching service to the photo fetching

- Due to time constraints the icons for the cells were not added & certain custom cell layouts

- Refactoring would be the next step to simplying the code base further

- Would have like to add more states to the view controllers 

- Would have been nice to include loading screens to simulate requests

- Some classes and models should have been exacted to their own files

# Instructions:

- Fork this git repo to your computer
- Create a branch
- When you are done, push your work and create a pull request to the original repo.

# Requirements

*Create a 3 page app.*

- When you launch the app, you should see a list of resource categories (`/data/categories.json`)
- When you click on a category, it should open a list of resources (`/data/restaurant.json` or `/data/vacation-spot.json`)
- When you click on a resource, it should open a details page (see attached mockup)

# Tips:

- You can showcase usage of Dependency Injection and Architecture Component.
- You can show how to handle threads.
- Remember you can always create a side project first and prepare yourself before jumping into the test.
- For JSON, you can use the RAW file version in git hub so you can simulate a call to remote API.
